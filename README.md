Overview




This project consists of a utility class MathUtil that contains several mathematical methods for prime number checking, GCD, LCM, Fibonacci sequence, factorial calculation, and more. The class includes both static and non-static methods for solving various mathematical problems, allowing it to be versatile and easy to use.
The Main class is provided to demonstrate the use of both static and non-static methods in MathUtil with various test cases.






Features



Prime number check - Determine if a number is prime.
GCD & LCM - Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two integers.
Fibonacci sequence - Return the nth Fibonacci number.
Factorial calculation - Compute the factorial of an integer.
Perfect number check - Determine if a number is a perfect number.
Sum of digits - Calculate the sum of digits of an integer.
Reverse a number - Reverse the digits of an integer.
Armstrong number check - Check if a number is an Armstrong number.
Next prime number - Find the next prime number greater than a given integer.


Installation



Clone or download the repository containing MathUtil.java and Main.java.
Open the project in your IDE or text editor.
Compile and run the Main class to test the utility methods.

Usage  



The utility methods in MathUtil can be called in two ways:
Static methods can be accessed directly from the class name.
Non-static methods require creating an instance of the MathUtil class.
